Differences from Perl's Template::Toolkit:

 * "0" (the string) is considered true
 * All keywords (directives and operators) are required to be upper-case
 * All math is done using 32-bit signed integers.


The following directives from Template::Toolkit are not supported:

 CALL
 PROCESS
 BLOCK


The following directives are supported with modification:

 INSERT, INCLUDE
 The filename must be specified as a string or variable expression.
 I.e. barewords are treated as variables.
